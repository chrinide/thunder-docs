# thunder-docs

> documentation for [`thunder`](https://github.com/thunder-project/thunder) and related modules

This repository contains two things:

- example tutorial notebooks
- a static documentation site made with [`minidocs`](https://github.com/freeman-lab/minidocs)

You can run the notebooks interactively by clicking this badge.

### for developers

If you want to add documentation, clone this repo and modify the source material as approrpiate, then call

```
npm install
npm start
```

And your browser should open with the rendered site.

### source components

Some site content is written directly as markdown. To modify this part of the documentation, just edit these files directly. The rest is derived from various external sources, including README files from other repositories (using the `ecosystem-docs` module), Python source code for automatic method documentation (using the `myopts` module), or Jupyter notebooks. To regenerate markdown content derived from all of these source files, call

```
npm run build
```

You need to have the `jupyter convert` command line tool available on your system for building, and you will need to update `conf.js` to point to a local copy of the [`thunder`](https://github.com/thunder-project/thunder) repository. 

### deployment

To generate the browserify bundle for deployment, call

```
npm run bundle
```
